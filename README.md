## 1. Overview: An Engine for Novel Ideas

**Zov Cognitive Sandbox** is a versatile tool for thought, creativity, and research. It leverages the power of advanced generative models to help you explore any topic, discover hidden connections, and generate novel hypotheses.

This application has two core components:

*   **The Sandbox:** A general-purpose creative environment where you can paste any textâ€”an article, a research paper, a block of code, or your own raw ideasâ€”and use the integrated **HNE (Hypothetical/Novel/Exploratory) Engine** to analyze the content and generate new, speculative ideas.
*   **The Framework Deep Dive:** An educational section that provides a complete, in-depth breakdown of the **Zov Cognitive Engine Blueprint (ZCEB v4.0)**, the powerful theoretical framework that powers this application. This is a living document that explains the science and philosophy behind the tool.

This project is a live, operational tool that *uses* the ZCEB framework to provide value, with the blueprint itself serving as a transparent, explorable foundation.
